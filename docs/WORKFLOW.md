# 🧩 Git Workflow for MentoroAI (2025)

This workflow describes the complete Git / GitHub process for **MentoroAI**,  
based on the current branching and merge rules.

---

## Branch Structure

| Branch                   | Purpose                                                   |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `main`                   | Stable production releases                                |
| `development`            | Active development base for features                      |
| `feature/<description>`  | Short-lived feature branches                              |
| `hotfix/<description>`   | Urgent production fixes derived from `main`               |

**Principles**

- `main` is never edited directly — only through PRs  
- `development` is the integration branch  
- New features branch from `development`  
- Releases merge from `development` → `main`

---

## Branch Rules (GitHub Settings)

### 🔹 main
- Require PR before merging  
- Require review (≥ 1 approval)  
- Require conversation resolution  
- Allow **Merge commits** (for releases)  
- Disallow force pushes or deletions  

### 🔹 development
- Require PR before merging  
- Enforce **linear history** ✅  
- Allow **Squash and Merge** (for features)  
- Disallow force pushes or deletions

## Merge Strategy

| From → To                | Method                 | Purpose                            |
|---------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `feature/* → development` | **Squash and Merge**   | Clean, single-commit history       |
| `development → main`      | **Create Merge Commit**| Release bundle with full history   |
| `hotfix/* → main`         | **Create Merge Commit**| Urgent production fix              |

> 💡 **No squash for releases!**  
> Prevents “1 commit ahead / behind” drift.

## Commit Conventions

```
feat(starter): add section editing in admin
fix(compare): correct breadcrumb links
docs(readme): add project overview
refactor(content): simplify mixin logic
chore(ci): add GitHub Actions cache
```

**Types:** `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `build`, `chore`, `ci`

---

## Feature Sync & Rebase

Before merging a feature branch:

- In PyCharm: Branch → **Update from development**  
  (rebases with latest `development`)  
- Resolve conflicts in editor → commit merge result  

---

## Release Process

1. Ensure `development` is stable (tests + manual check passed)  
2. Create PR → `development → main`  
3. Title: `release: vX.Y.Z`  
4. Merge method: **Create Merge Commit**  
5. On GitHub: **Releases → Draft new release → Tag** (`vX.Y.Z`)  
6. After release: update `development` from `main` to sync  

---

## Hotfix Flow

1. Branch → **New Branch → hotfix/<description>** (from `main`)  
2. Commit & push fix  
3. PR → `main`, merge commit  
4. Sync `main` → `development` afterwards  

---

## Common Issues

| Problem                    | Cause                                | Solution                                  |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| “1 commit ahead / behind”  | Squash merge used for release        | Use **merge commit** for releases         |
| Conflicts                  | Out-of-sync branches                 | Use **Merge Conflicts** dialog in PyCharm |
| “Force push forbidden”     | Branch protection rule               | Expected — keeps repo safe                |
| PR blocked by checks        | Missing CI workflow                 | Disable checks until CI configured        |

---

## Naming Conventions

| Type     | Example                | Description             |
|-----------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| Feature   | `feature/editor-rbac`  | new module / feature    |
| Fix       | `fix/compare-links`    | small correction        |
| Hotfix    | `hotfix/runtime-error` | urgent production fix   |

---

## Roles & Permissions

| Role          | Responsibilities                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Maintainer** | Merge/review, branch protection, releases |
| **Contributor**| Feature PRs, code changes              |
| **Reviewer**   | Code review & feedback                 |

---

## TL;DR

1. Work in `development`  
2. Create feature branch → commit & push  
3. PR → `development` → Squash & Merge  
4. Release PR `development → main` → Merge Commit  
5. Tag release `vX.Y.Z`

---

✅ **Result**

- Clean, traceable Git history  
- Full GitHub integration  
- No “ahead/behind” confusion  
- Clear separation between development and release phases
